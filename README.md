# Speech-Synthesis-and-Recognition

I implemented speech end-pointing techniques, pre-emphasis methods, and MFCC feature extraction to develop a robust word-level GMM-Hidden Markov Model framework for accurate word recognition in spoken utterances. I designed a single-formant resonator to synthesize vowels by incorporating glottal pulse shaping, lip radiation filtering, and aspiration noise. Additionally, I utilized PRAAT software to analyze spectrograms and classify male and female speech, focusing on pitch and formant estimation to enhance acoustic analysis.
